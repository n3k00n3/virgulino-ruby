## Working on your own branch

   This is your own copy of the `virgulino-ruby` project to work in.
2. Clone your repository to your local machine.
3. `git checkout -b newbranch`
This creates a new branch, called `newbranch` in our example, in your local
repository.
4. Make your changes.
5. `git commit`
6. `git push origin newdesign:newdesign`
This pushes your new branch called `newdesign` to your GitHub repository.
