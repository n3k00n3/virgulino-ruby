## Working on your own branch

   This is your own copy of the `virgulino-ruby` project to work in.
2. Clone your repository to your local machine.
3. `git checkout -b newbranch`
This creates a new branch, called `newbranch` in our example, in your local
repository.
4. Make your changes.
5. `git add --all`
5. `git commit -m "A comment based on the featured added or fixing matters"`
6. `git push origin newbranch`
This pushes your new branch called `newbranch` to your GitHub repository.

## Integrating your working code to master
