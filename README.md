# virgulino

Virgulino emerged as a simple steganography experiment. Just as study and programming practice. But as time passed the project grew.

Now it works with some cipher (like Caesar, Vigenere and xor). Our idea is to make it works with algorithms like AES, DES and others. Also, of course, come back to the first goal: steganography (into images, audios...).
